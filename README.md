# OCS SOPs

## Formatting

All alerts are present here in an **SOP** format. Please note that these need to be structured into a **runbook** format when these go into the official documentation.

This means that the format present in the repository right now,

```
    Check Description
    Overview
    Prerequisites
    Alert
    Troubleshooting
```

needs to be modified to the following before pushing to official documentation,

```
    Meaning
    Impact
    Diagnosis
    Mitigation
```

Plese refer [OpenShift runbooks](https://github.com/openshift/runbooks) for more information on formatting.
